/**
 * golden-copy-utils.ts — shared helpers for the golden-copy suites in
 * scripts/__tests__/ (workflow-embedded programs vs versioned golden copies).
 *
 * The canonical-form helper was previously duplicated in every golden-copy
 * suite (canonicalShell in workflow-prove-gate-golden.test.ts, canonicalAwk in
 * release-assert-route-gate.test.ts, canonicalShell in the deleted
 * workflow-healthcheck-golden.test.ts). Extracted here so a 4th suite imports
 * instead of copy-pasting — a divergence in the canonicalizer itself would
 * silently weaken EVERY divergence guard at once.
 *
 * The subprocess runner + CRLF normalization + temp-dir registry were also
 * duplicated across the shim harnesses (runProveGateProgram / runAwkProgram /
 * runScript in the health-check suite): every harness spawned bash/awk with
 * the same shape (env merged over process.env, utf8, 30s timeout) and
 * normalized CRLF before piping programs into bash (a Windows checkout via
 * `* text=auto` → CRLF would break bash parsing on `\r`). Centralized here so
 * the 4th suite inherits the same hardening by default instead of
 * re-implementing it per-harness.
